## Challenge: more ideas

Now that you have explored the basics of the Sense HAT, you might want to investigate other things to do with it:

 - Tell a joke on the LED screen.
 - If your Sense HAT is connected to the internet, you could use a Twitter API library to make it display incoming tweets.
 - Create your own images to display on the LED matrix.
 - Can you alternate between images to create an animation? Check out this [Geek Gurl Diaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b84EywkQ3HI) video for some inspiration.
 - Create an electronic die[like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfP-R6ArMSk). Shaking the Pi triggers the roll of the die.
 - Create a simple graphical thermometer which outputs different colours or patterns depending on the temperature.
- Write a program that displays an arrow (or other symbol) on screen; this symbol could be used to point to which way is down. This way, astronauts in low gravity always know where the Earth is.
- Use the accelerometer to sense small movements â€” this could form part of a game, alarm system, or even an earthquake sensor.
- Make use of the humidity sensor to detect breath and display a colour depending on the humidity.
