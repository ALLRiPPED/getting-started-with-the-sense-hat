## Introduction

### What you will make
The Sense HAT, which is a fundamental part of the [Astro Pi](https://astro-pi.org/) mission, allows your Raspberry Pi to sense the world around it.

In this project, you will learn how to control the Sense HAT's LED matrix and collect sensor data, and you will combine these ideas in a number of small projects.

### What you will learn
By following this resource with your Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT you will learn how to:

- Communicate with the Sense HAT using Python
- Access the outputs of the Sense HAT
- Program the inputs of the Sense HAT
- Use the Sense HAT library to display messages and images
- Use variables to store sensor data
- Use loops to repeat behaviours

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)
- [Process input data to monitor or react to the environment](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/developer)
