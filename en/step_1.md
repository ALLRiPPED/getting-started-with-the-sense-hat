## Introduction

### What you will make
The Sense HAT, which is a fundamental part of the Astro Pi Mission, allows your Raspberry Pi to sense the world around it.

You will learn how to control the LED matrix, collect sensor data from the world around you, and combine these ideas in a number of small projects.

### What you will learn
By following this resource with your Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT you will learn:

- How to use Python to communicate with the Sense HAT
- How to access and program the inputs and outputs of the Sense HAT
- How to use the Sense HAT library to display messages and images, control orientation, gather sensor data, and respond to movement
- How to use variables to store sensor data
- How to use loops to repeat some behaviours

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)
- [Process input data to monitor or react to the environment](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/developer)
