## What is a Sense HAT?

The Sense HAT is an add-on board for the Raspberry Pi, made especially for the [Astro Pi](http://astro-pi.org/){:target="_blank"} competition. The board adds the ability to sense temperature, humidity, pressure and orientation, and to output information using a built-in LED matrix.

If you don't have access to a real Sense HAT, you can use an emulator.
