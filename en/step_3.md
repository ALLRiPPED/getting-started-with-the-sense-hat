## Getting Started with the Sense HAT

The Sense HAT is an add-on board for the Raspberry Pi, made especially for the [Astro Pi](http://astro-pi.org/) competition. The board adds the ability to sense all kinds of things, and to output information using a built-in LED matrix. 

Once you are set up and have run your first program using the guide, you can begin to experiment further using this worksheet. If you don't have access to a Sense HAT, then you can use the emulator available on [trinket.io](https://trinket.io/), or the embeded trinkets in this worksheet.
