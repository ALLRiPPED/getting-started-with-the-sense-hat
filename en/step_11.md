## What next?

- Now that you have explored the basics of the Sense HAT, you might investigate the Python library itself to see some other functions it offers.
- Try out the 3D Soyuz Demo which allows you to use the Sense HAT to move a virtual 3D model. Why not try creating your own models with [Sketchup](http://www.sketchup.com/) or [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)?
- Link the the Sense HAT sensor data with [minecraft-pi](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-minecraft-pi/).

### Ideas

 - Could you use the ideas used so far to tell a joke via the LED screen?
 - All the examples so far could be made shorter, while still achieving the same thing. Can you find ways to make these shorter and more efficient?
 - How would you choose a totally random colour, rather than just a random shade of a colour?
 - If your Sense HAT is connected to the internet, you could use a Twitter library to make it display incoming tweets!



 ### Ideas

 - Now that you can create images on your LED matrix in two different ways, try creating your own images or sprites.
 - Can you alternate between images to create an animation? Check out this [Geek Gurl Diaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b84EywkQ3HI) video for some inspiration.
