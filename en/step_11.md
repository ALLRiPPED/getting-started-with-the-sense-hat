## Getting Started with the Sense HAT

The Sense HAT is an add-on board for the Raspberry Pi, made especially for the [Astro Pi](http://astro-pi.org/) competition. The board adds the ability to sense all kinds of things and output information using a built-in 8x8 LED matrix. You can find out more about what the Sense HAT can do by following the [Astro Pi Guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/astro-pi-guide/), which will show you how to connect and test your Sense HAT. It also has some helpful explanations and examples of what the different inputs and outputs can do.

Once you are set up and have run your first program using the guide, you can begin to experiment further using this worksheet. If you don't have access to a SenseHAT, then you can use the emulator available on [trinket.io](https://trinket.io/), or the embeded trinkets in this worksheet.
