## What next?

- Now that you have explored the basics of the Sense HAT, you might investigate the Python library itself to see some other functions it offers.
- Try out the 3D Soyuz Demo which allows you to use the Sense HAT to move a virtual 3D model. Why not try creating your own models with [Sketchup](http://www.sketchup.com/) or [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)?
- Link the the Sense HAT sensor data with [minecraft-pi](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-minecraft-pi/).
